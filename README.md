Hello! Thank you for checking out my project page for Microsoft Engage '22. I'm Pramika Garg, a sophomore Computer Science & Engineering student from Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore and I'm participating in the Data Analytics track with my mentor Mr. Deepak Garg's support!

This project is designed with a multitude of different technologies and tech stacks, including but not limited to: HTML5, SASS, CSS3, ES6 JavaScript, Material UI (Google), IPython, R Markdown, PyCaret among many others. 

The project has been split into three sections:
- In the first section, Data Engineering covers data cleansing and engineering with exploratory data analysis;
- The second section covers extensive data visualization which is managed with R/Python;
- Finally last but not the least the third section covers, clustering based machine learning models and analytics with automation followed by in-depth analysis.

The source code for the entire project is available here.
